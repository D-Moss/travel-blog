		After not being able to travel due to Covid, when the lockdown was lifted, I neeed to get away even if it ws just for a weekend. I made plans to go to Las Vegas from August 29th through the 31st and even though it was just the weekend, I didn't plan on staying in my room the whole time.
	</p>
	<p>
		I arrived in Las Vegas on the afternoon of August 29th and after retrieving my luggage, I made my way to the Luxor hotel. Checking in was quick and easy; after a quick upgrade to my room, I was off to see where I would be staying for next few days.
		<br>
		My room was nice but I didn't see much of it at the time because I need to eat, shower and change before it was time for me to head back out the door. I put my luggage away then went to grab a slice of pizza.
